<h1 align="center">CAFOSat: A Strongly Annotated Dataset for Infrastructure-Aware CAFO Mapping Using High-Resolution Imagery</h1>

![CAFOSat Overview](figures/Cafo_Pipeline_1.jpg)


## 🗺️ CAFOSAT: Dataset Summary

CAFOSat is a large-scale, high-resolution dataset designed to support infrastructure-aware mapping of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) across the United States. The dataset spans **2,064 counties** and contains over **45,000 image patches** extracted from NAIP imagery, each at **833×833 pixels** with a **0.3-0.6m spatial resolution**.

CAFOSat captures a wide array of CAFO infrastructure and operations, supporting advanced remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and machine learning research.

## 📦 Key Features

- **Diverse Coverage**: Images span six major CAFO types and are sourced from a combination of **federal, state, and academic datasets**, ensuring diverse geographic and operational representation.
- **High-Quality Annotations**:
  - **Facility-Level Labels**: Each patch includes CAFO-type classifications.
  - **Infrastructure-Level Labels**: Detailed manual annotations for structures such as barns, manure lagoons, feed storage, and more for ~3000 CAFO Location.
- **Synthetic Subset**: Includes a manually validated set of synthetic images to support testing of domain generalization and augmentation robustness. (~6500 Patches)
- **Hard Negatives**: Carefully curated negative samples that closely resemble CAFO environments but do not contain actual facilities — ideal for training discriminative models.(~23k Patches)

#### 📝 Description

- `{state}_filtered/`: Original geolocation image patches organized by state, including refined geolocation image patches organized by state.
- `barn/manure_pond/others`: Synthetic data generated by augmentation techniques, categorized by infrastructure type.
- `negative_sample/`: Hard negative samples—image patches visually similar to CAFOs but containing no actual CAFOs.
- `cafosat.csv`: CSV files containing metadata for both real and augmented patches (e.g., geolocation, type, annotations, bounding box, weak geolocation, refined geolocation etc).
