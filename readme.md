# CAFOSat: A Strongly Annotated Dataset for Infrastructure-Aware CAFO Mapping Using High-Resolution Imagery

![CAFOSat Overview](figures/cafosat_overview.pdf)

## 🗺️ Dataset Summary

CAFOSat is a large-scale, high-resolution dataset designed to support infrastructure-aware mapping of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) across the United States. The dataset spans **2,064 counties** and contains over **45,000 image patches** extracted from NAIP imagery, each at **833×833 pixels** with a **0.3-0.6m spatial resolution**.

CAFOSat captures a wide array of CAFO infrastructure and operations, supporting advanced remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and machine learning research.

## 📦 Key Features

- **Diverse Coverage**: Images span six major CAFO types and are sourced from a combination of **federal, state, and academic datasets**, ensuring diverse geographic and operational representation.
- **High-Quality Annotations**:
  - **Facility-Level Labels**: Each patch includes CAFO-type classifications.
  - **Infrastructure-Level Labels**: Detailed manual annotations for structures such as barns, manure lagoons, feed storage, and more for ~3000 CAFO Location.
- **Synthetic Subset**: Includes a manually validated set of synthetic images to support testing of domain generalization and augmentation robustness. (~6500 Patches)
- **Hard Negatives**: Carefully curated negative samples that closely resemble CAFO environments but do not contain actual facilities — ideal for training discriminative models.(~23k Patches)

## 🧠 Annotation Pipeline

CAFOSat is built using a **human-in-the-loop scalable annotation framework** designed to refine weakly annotated geolocation data into **strong, high-fidelity labels**. This pipeline:
- Reduces manual annotation effort through iterative refinement.
- Supports extensibility to other domains or regions.
- Enables continuous dataset expansion with minimal overhead.

## 🔬 Potential Applications

- CAFO Detection & Localization
- Infrastructure Segmentation
- Environmental Risk Assessment
- Synthetic-to-Real Domain Adaptation

### 📝 Description

- `point_single_patches/`: Original geolocation image patches organized by state, including refined geolocation image patches organized by state.
- `augmented_data_image/`: Synthetic data generated by augmentation techniques, categorized by infrastructure type.
- `negative_sample/`: Hard negative samples—image patches visually similar to CAFOs but containing no actual CAFOs.
- `metadata/`: CSV files containing metadata for both real and augmented patches (e.g., geolocation, type, annotations, bounding box, weak geolocation, refined geolocation etc).
